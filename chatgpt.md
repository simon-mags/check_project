Could that same model work for tasks within an existing file called uptime.yml which has a Solaris task and a red hat task, if they have an ansible operating system family tag and a second tag of never so they donâ€™t run unless called?



Yes, you can apply dynamic tags to tasks within an existing file based on the operating system family and an additional tag to control their execution. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

1. Modify your `uptime.yml` file to include the dynamic tags and the additional tag. For example:

```yaml
- name: Uptime task for Red Hat servers
  debug:
    msg: "This task is specific to Red Hat servers"
  tags:
    - redhat
    - never

- name: Uptime task for Solaris servers
  debug:
    msg: "This task is specific to Solaris servers"
  tags:
    - solaris
    - never
```

2. Modify your playbook to include the dynamic tags and selectively run the tasks. For example:

```yaml
- name: Playbook for server checks
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: true
  vars_files:
    - vars.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Include tasks for the specific OS family
      include_tasks: uptime.yml
      tags: "{{ os_tag_mapping[ansible_facts['ansible_os_family']] }}"
```

With this setup, when you run the playbook, only the tasks with matching dynamic tags (based on the operating system family) and the "never" tag will be executed. For example, if the server is a Solaris server, only the tasks with the "solaris" and "never" tags will be executed from the `uptime.yml` file.

Yes, you can use dynamic tags based on the Ansible facts for the operating system family. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

1. Modify your tasks in the playbook by adding tags based on the operating system family. For example:

```yaml
- name: Task for Red Hat servers
  debug:
    msg: "This task is specific to Red Hat servers"
  tags:
    - redhat

- name: Task for Solaris servers
  debug:
    msg: "This task is specific to Solaris servers"
  tags:
    - solaris
```

2. Create a variable file, let's say `vars.yml`, that maps the operating system family to the corresponding tag. For example:

```yaml
os_tag_mapping:
  RedHat: redhat
  Solaris: solaris
```

3. Modify your playbook to include the `vars.yml` file and use the dynamic tags. For example:

```yaml
- name: Playbook for server checks
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: true
  vars_files:
    - vars.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Include tasks for the specific OS family
      include_tasks: "{{ ansible_facts['ansible_os_family'] }}.yml"
      tags: "{{ os_tag_mapping[ansible_facts['ansible_os_family']] }}"
```

4. Create separate task files for each operating system family, named `RedHat.yml` and `Solaris.yml`, that contain the specific tasks for that OS family.

With this setup, when you run the playbook, only the tasks with matching tags will be executed based on the operating system family. For example, if the server is a Red Hat server, only the tasks tagged with `redhat` will be executed.
